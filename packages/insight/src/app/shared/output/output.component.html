        TODO: this should be the most linked-to view in Insight. It is the ideal
        place for most wallets to link to when showing users their previous
        "transactions". For most wallets (including Copay/BitPay currently),
        users are sending a single payment to a single address in a
        "transaction", i.e. an Output. Showing the user only that output makes
        for a much better, easier to understand experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g. Alice sends Bob $10. Her wallet creates a transaction using the
        closest available output – in Alice's case, she's not used the wallet
        much before, and just withdrew $1000 from an exchange. The wallet sends
        $10 to Bob, and $990 back to an internal change address. In the
        transaction history, Alice can see the $10 payment. Out of curiosity,
        she clicks through to "view her transaction on the blockchain". When she
        sees the "$1000 transaction" panic ensues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outputs still need to be designed – we could consider a view that looks
        almost like a transaction receipt. If any view in Insight is also for a
        "non-technical" audience, it's this one. The most important element is
        the `value` (in the user's displayAs currency). Other data we will want
        to include: `timeNormalized`, `address` (or `lockingScript` if no
        address format applies), "included in transaction", "mined in block",
        "confirmations" and if it has already been spent, "used in input".
        `lockingScript` should always be possible to see, even if the output has
        a valid address (maybe in a detail view, or if the user clicks on the
        address).
